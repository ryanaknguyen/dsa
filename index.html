        <p class="learn-more-description">
          This website was made to provide information about data structures and algorithms, 
          two of the most important topics that companies look for when hiring candidates for software engineering roles. 
        </p>
        <p class="learn-more-description summary">
          Whether you are completely new to these concepts or brushing up your coding skills that you have forgotten,
          one small step can go a long way to becoming a successful software engineer.

        <h2 class="learn-more-header">Data Structures</h2>
        <p class="learn-more-description">
          Data structures are essentially computational collections that store and use data in some way. There are many
          different data structures that exist, each with different unique functions, and this website will contain references
          to the data structures most commonly-used within the computing industry. 
        </p>
        <p class="learn-more-description summary">
          Understanding data structures proficiently
          will help you understand the quickest and the best one to use for your program's intended function. 
        </p>

      <div class="algorithms learn-more-subsection">
        <h2 class="learn-more-header">Algorithms</h2>
        <p class="learn-more-description">
          Algorithms are approaches to solving a problem, like following an instruction manual. When approached with a problem,
          there are possibly many ways that the problem can be solved. However, one way may be faster than the other and better
          in the long run. 
        </p>
        <p class="learn-more-description summary">
          Knowing different algorithms will help you solve problems in an efficient manner and choose which
          approach works best for your needs.
